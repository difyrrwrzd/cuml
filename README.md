# cuML

Machine learning is a fundamental capability of RAPIDS. cuML is a suite of libraries that implements a machine learning algorithms within the RAPIDS data science ecosystem. cuML enables data scientists, researchers, and software engineers to run traditional ML tasks on GPUs without going into the details of CUDA programming.

The cuML repository contains:

1. ***python***: Python based GPU Dataframe (GDF) machine learning package that takes [cuDF](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf) dataframes as input. cuML connects the data to C++/CUDA based cuML and ml-prims libraries without ever leaving GPU memory.

2. ***cuML***: C++/CUDA machine learning algorithms. This library currently includes the following six algorithms;
   a) Single GPU Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (tSVD),
   b) Single GPU Principal Component Analysis (PCA),
   c) Single GPU Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN),
   d) Single GPU Kalman Filtering,
   e) Multi-GPU K-Means Clustering,
   f) Multi-GPU K-Nearest Neighbors (Uses [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)).

3. ***ml-prims***: Low level machine learning primitives used in cuML. ml-prims is comprised of the following components;
   a) Linear Algebra,
   b) Statistics,
   c) Basic Matrix Operations,
   d) Distance Functions,
   e) Random Number Generation.

#### Available Algorithms:

- Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (tSVD).

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

- Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN).

- K-Means Clustering.

- K-Nearest Neighbors (Requires [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) installation to use).

Upcoming algorithms:

- Kalman Filter.

More ML algorithms in cuML and more ML primitives in ml-prims are being added currently. Example notebooks are provided in the python folder to test the functionality and performance. Goals for future versions include more algorithms and multi-gpu versions of the algorithms and primitives.

The installation option provided currently consists on building from source. Upcoming versions will add `pip` and `conda` options, along docker containers. They will be available in the coming weeks.


## Setup

cuML is available from the rapidsai conda channel:
```
# Install dependencies first
conda install -c pytorch faiss-gpu cuda92
conda install -c rapidsai cuml
```

### Dependencies for Installing/Building from Source:

To use cuML from source, it must be cloned and built in an environment that already has the dependencies, including [cuDF](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf) and its dependencies.

List of dependencies:

1. [cuDF](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf) (>=0.2.0)
2. zlib
3. cmake (>= 3.8, version 3.11.4 is recommended and there are issues with version 3.12)
4. CUDA (>= 9.2)
5. Cython (>= 0.28)
6. gcc (>=5.4.0)
7. faiss-gpu (>=1.4.0) - To install with conda: ```conda install -c pytorch faiss-gpu cuda92```

### Setup steps

To clone:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rapidsai/cuml.git
```

To build the python package, in the repository root folder:

```
python setup.py install
```

### Building CuML:

### Running tests

To test the C++ algorithms using googletests, in the repository root folder:

```bash
$ cd cuML
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j
$ ./ml_test
```

### Python Notebooks

Demo notebooks can be found in python/notebooks folder.

## External

The external folders contains submodules that this project in-turn depends on. Appropriate location flags
will be automatically populated in the main CMakeLists.txt file for these.

Current external submodules are:

- [CUTLASS](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass)
- [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest)
- [CUB](https://github.com/NVlabs/cub)
