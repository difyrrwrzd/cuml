# cuML Wiki Documentation

This wiki is provided as an extension to cuML's public documentation, geared toward developers on the project.

If you are interested in contributing to cuML, read through our [contributing guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md). You are
also encouraged to read through our Python [developer guide](python/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) and C++ 
[developer guide](cpp/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) to gain an understanding for how we design our algorithms.

We explicitly define our [definition of done criteria](DEFINITION_OF_DONE_CRITERIA.md) so that we can strive to provide quality implementations, while maintaining transparency in the status of our algorithms with our users.
